## About

This bot was created to jokingly reference the character Vergil from the [Devil May Cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_May_Cry) game series.

## Usage

The bot will post relevant responses when users send messages containing certain words (and some variations and misspellings). Currently, these words are:
* `motivation`, `motivated`, `motive`
* `bedtime`, `sleep`, `good night`
* `power`
* `difficult`, `hard`, `challenging`
* `storm`, `bury the light`
* `curious`, `interesting`, `strange`, `wtf`
